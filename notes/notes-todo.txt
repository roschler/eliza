// Todo list

GOALS:

NEXT: Need to find the right spot to inspect the response from the user
    to a bill-of-materials line item direct question and:

        + If the preliminary question was just asked, determine if the
            user response is "false" | "true" | "query" by asking the
            LLM to determine that from the question we asked and the
            user's input.  Then take the appropriate action for each
            choice and update the Goal and its objectives properly.


- Add code to handle "::<character name>" values in a BillOfMaterialsLineItem
  object's ListOfValues field (need to fill out buildBillOfMaterialsQuestion()
  function to handle ListOfValues fields).

- Add code to create prompts and handle boolean and number line items

// TODO: Now it is time to modify the LLM prompt by creating the bill-of-materials
//  sub-prompt for insertion into the message handler template.  See bookmark #1.

- SPSTART message template is not outputting a proper JSON object when the user just wants to chat.

- Refine each of the participating characters in our team of agents Eliza app and perfect each of the relevant fields in those JSON files.
