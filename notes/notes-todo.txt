// Todo list

GOALS:

- Refine each of the participating characters in our team of agents Eliza app and perfect each of the relevant fields in those JSON files.

NOTES:
    - [AGENT] The agent workspace creates the database and starts/loads the agents
    - [DIRECT CLIENT] The direct client (in our fork) starts the server that the agent POST's requests to.  The agent uses a "localhost" URL to post to this server.
    - [CORE] The core provides the guts of the database code that does the database operations.
