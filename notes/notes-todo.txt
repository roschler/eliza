GOALS:

    - If RESET command or resetGoalsOnInitialActivation is TRUE and agent/character just
       activated either due to an agent/character switch or first-time app launch,
       build the main goal and its objectives from the current character's bill-of-materials
       line items.  But first, remove all goals for the current room-id + agent/Character
       ID combination.

       STRATEGY NOTE: The getGoals() call requires a room ID.  We prepend the room ID to
        all user and agent/character ID's, BUT, we still create the goal with a room ID
        so we can remove all the goals for all characters in the same room with the
        removeAllGoals(roomId) call.


- SPSTART message template is not outputting a proper JSON object when the user just wants to chat.

- Refine each of the participating characters in our team of agents Eliza app and perfect each of the relevant fields in those JSON files.
