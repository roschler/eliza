// This file contains some notes on the call chain involved in making an
//  Eliza LLM call.

// Need to handle validation failures due to bill-of-materials line item
//  constraints.

// Remember to save/update the Goal!  It may have been altered.

// Need to implement the "<string choice>:<agent/character-name>" idiom.

// Where do I handle "CHANGE" and "CANCEL", including the agent switch
//  for a "CANCEL" intent receipt?

// Everything appears to resolve down to the aiGenerateText() call:

    const { text: openaiResponse } = await aiGenerateText({
        model: openai.languageModel(model),
        prompt: context,
        system:
            runtime.character.system ??
            settings.SYSTEM_PROMPT ??
            undefined,
        temperature: temperature,
        maxTokens: max_response_length,
        frequencyPenalty: frequency_penalty,
        presencePenalty: presence_penalty,
    });

// As you can see, the prompt + system prompt paradigm is used and not the
//  alternative and mutually exclusive "messages" paradigm.  Also, the
//  system prompt takes the first available option in order from:

    [runtime.character.system, settings.SYSTEM_PROMPT (environment variable)]

// Falling back to "undefined" as a last resort.
